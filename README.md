We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-vnet/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
module "virtual-network" {
 source              = "clouddrove/vnet/azure"
 name                = "app"
 environment         = "test"
 label_order         = ["name", "environment"]
 resource_group_name = module.resource_group.resource_group_name
 location            = module.resource_group.resource_group_location
 address_space       = "10.0.0.0/16"
 enable_ddos_pp      = false
 }
  ```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| address\_space | The address space that is used by the virtual network. | `string` | `""` | no |
| address\_spaces | The list of the address spaces that is used by the virtual network. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| dns\_servers | The DNS servers to be used with vNet. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| enable | Flag to control the module creation | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enable\_ddos\_pp | Flag to control the resource creation | `bool` | `false` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| location | The location/region where the virtual network is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `""` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-virtual-network"` | no |
| resource\_group\_name | The name of the resource group in which to create the virtual network. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `""` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| vnet\_address\_space | The address space of the newly created vNet |
| vnet\_guid | The GUID of the virtual network. |
| vnet\_id | The id of the newly created vNet |
| vnet\_location | The location of the newly created vNet |
| vnet\_name | The name of the newly created vNet |
| vnet\_rg\_name | The name of the resource group in which to create the virtual network. Changing this forces a new resource to be created |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
