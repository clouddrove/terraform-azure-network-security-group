We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 






## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-network-security-group/releases).


### Basic Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
 ```hcl
    module "network_security_group" {
    source                  = "clouddrove/network-security-group/azure"
    name                    = local.name
    environment             = local.environment
    resource_group_name     = "app-storage-test-resource-group"
    resource_group_location = "North Europe"
    subnet_ids              = ["/subscriptions/068245d4-3c94-42fe-9c4d-9e5e1cabc60c/resourceGroups/"]
    inbound_rules = [
      {
        name                       = "ssh"
        priority                   = 101
        access                     = "Allow"
        protocol                   = "Tcp"
        source_address_prefix      = "10.20.0.0/32"
        source_port_range          = "*"
        destination_address_prefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
        destination_port_range     = "22"
        description                = "ssh allowed port"
      },
      {
        name                       = "https"
        priority                   = 102
        access                     = "Allow"
        protocol                   = "*"
        source_address_prefix      = "VirtualNetwork"
        source_port_range          = "80,443"
        destination_address_prefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
        destination_port_range     = "22"
        description                = "ssh allowed port"
      }
    ]
     enable_diagnostic = false

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
