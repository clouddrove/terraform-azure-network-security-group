We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-network-security-group/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ```hcl
   module "network_security_group" {
    source                  = "clouddrove/subnet/network-security-group"
    version                 = "1.0.0"
    resource_group_location = module.resource_group.resource_group_location
    source                  = "../"
    label_order             = ["name", "environment"]
    app_name                = "app"
    environment             = "test"
    subnet_ids              = module.subnet.default_subnet_id
    resource_group_name     = module.resource_group.resource_group_name
    inbound_rules = [
    {
      name                       = "ssh"
      priority                   = 101
      access                     = "Allow"
      protocol                   = "Tcp"
      source_address_prefix      = "67.23.123.234/32"
      #source_address_prefixes    = ["67.23.123.234/32","67.20.123.234/32"]
      source_port_range          = "*"
      destination_address_prefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
      destination_port_range     = "22"
      description                = "ssh allowed port"
    },
    {
      name                       = "https"
      priority                   = 102
      access                     = "Allow"
      protocol                   = "*"
      source_address_prefix      = "VirtualNetwork"
      source_port_range          = "80,443"
      destination_address_prefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
      destination_port_range     = "22"
      description                = "ssh allowed port"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
